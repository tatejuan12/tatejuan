								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I’d say that my interest in IT started when I was a child and my father bought a PC. I started to mess around with the computer, and for the past decade, I have honed my PC skills. My interest in IT is really diverse, I love computers, but also love the whole ecosystem, the stuff that happens behind the scenes. My IT experience comes from tinkering with computers for a decade, I also taught myself how to code in a intermediate level, I used codecademy to achieve this.</p>
								<p>I chose to study in RMIT because I believe that it is one of the best universities for IT. Moreover, it is located in the wonderful city of Melbourne, which is a huge bonus. Additionally, RMIT is located in the heart of the city, I don’t have to use transport as much, because the university is located in a great place and I live 5 minutes walking from it.</p>
								<p>During my studies, I intend to learn about the whole structure of IT, I want to be good in everything related to IT, but to be fairly honest, I would like to dedicate more effort into my programming skills, since that is something that I would like to do in the future.</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The role of the <a href="https://company.onefootball.com/careers/80">position</a> is keeping “Onefootball’s web presence”, where you pick technologies and ideas and implement them to better their web presence. You will collaborate with designers and engineers, and will also have to code.</p>
								<p>You need have several years of experience in web development, moreover you need to be able to work in groups, and more importantly, you have to know how to code in React, Vue.js, Javascript, Typescript, etc…</p>
								<p>I don’t have experience in web development at all, but I do know how to code in javascript on a basic level.</p>
								<p>To be able to get this position, I would need to have experience in web development, so that would be the first step, finding a job with low entry requirements for web development. From there, enhance my skills in coding, especially in those languages.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/myting.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>These tests show that I am an extremely confident and stable person. I can deal with my emotions most of the time, and do not let others drag me down. I also am extraverted, so I don’t have problems making friends and expressing myself to others, Additionally, I am not a organized person, but I get the job done. My rational side is stronger than my emotional one, and I am really crafty when it comes to solutions, I usually do not plan things, I just do it and figure it out on the way. I’m also a tactile learner, hence I need to do things in order to learn in the best way.</p>
								<p>The tests show me that I work well in groups, but I’m not usually the one who gives directions, I just usually go with the flow, I’m not the leader of the group in most occasions. These results might sway me to be a bit more assertive when in groups, by trying to lead more.</p>
								<p>I should try to find people that do not care about unorganized work. Moreover, I do work whenever I feel like doing it, hence someone that puts deadlines in a group would probably not like having me as a group member.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The project that I selected to make in the future is to develop a website and possibly a smartphone app that enables the users to chat about the thousands of sports that we have on the planet, ranging from the least known to the most known sports. The app will work as a forum, and would be modeled around the idea of Reddit, but would focus on sports.</p>
								<p>I use Reddit a lot, for several different reasons. I like chatting to people about diverse topics, however, Reddits audience is really diverse, hence the developers cannot focus on a specific demographic. I use Reddit a lot to chat about sports, most specifically football and basketball, two sports in which I am very passionate about. There I can talk to people that cheer to the same team as mine, to my opponents and share ideas and opinions. However, it is evident to me that the diverse demographic of the Reddit community makes the developers not focus on what us, the sports audience wants. For example, we really want a better UI, that facilitates the exposure of scores and information. This hasn’t happened, rather, Reddit has recently changed the UI to something that, in my opinion, is way worse.</p>
								<p>First of all, there would be a greater control in the website. Reddit does not have any control at all, whoever wants to create a page about something can, but on our website we would have control of what subtopics would have pages created for them. For example, our team of developers would go and create a page for football, for Barcelona, for the Golden State Warriors, etc… This ecosystem is better, because this would enable us to create an environment that we want to have, and would maintain a good quality all across the board. There are countless subreddits out there that are just lazy and effortless. We would work to maintain a good environment for all of our users. We would also want to have a good public relations team in order to know what the users want. This would enable us to have a good methodology towards our UI, or, User Centered Design. However, it is important to emphasize that our team would only be in charge of the UI, the visual appearance of these subpages, they would still have people that serve as admins in order to monitor what is going on in these pages. This is important since there would be thousands of subpages, and our team would not be able to manage all of them at the same time. So, we create the pages and maintain them periodically, however, the admins of these pages are still in charge of what is going on most of the time. These admins would have the power to create discussions with more “importance”, would be able to delete comments and also kick or ban subscribers of the sport page. Moreover, we would like to have more integrated features that Reddit does not give to the user. One example is giving the user to create polls directly through the website. On Reddit the user has to go out of his way to create a poll outside of Reddit, while in our app we can just create a poll inside of it. Polls are important for the sports audience since we can know the opinion of which team/player is better, for example. The sports audience really likes to give opinions to each other. Additionally, we would like to give users the best interface possible. I believe that a good UI is the key to maintaining the user’s interest. The interface would be clean, possibly follow a materialistic design. We would include several different themes for our website, and make sure that we offer a dark option for those who like darker themes. Our website would also need to be ported well towards smartphones. I believe nowadays for a website to be used, it needs to be able to work really well on smartphones because a lot of traffic is on smartphones.</p>
								<p>We would be making a website, hence the software that we need is just a computer to code the website. We would also need somewhere to host our servers. On the other hand, the users will need a computer with basic hardware, since going on the internet does not require a beefy hardware, and he would also need some sort of internet browser like Firefox or Google Chrome to be able to access our website.</p>
								<p>There are several skills that would be required to accomplish the goal of creating this website. First of all, I would probably need to be able to code really well, with an emphasis on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Other languages are also probably going to be used. It would help if I could find a crew of good coders to help me along the way, since my project is really ambitious, and for it to work I would eventually need staff. We would need servers to host our website, but that can be done through a third party medium.</p>
								<p>If the project is successful, then I will probably be an extremely rich individual, and I will have made a large portion of the Reddit demographic happy because I do not believe that Reddit is a good place to initiate discussions in regards to sports. If successful, we would also show that a behemoth like Reddit can indeed be challenged by a new website. The sports audience would finally have a good place to discuss about their teams and sports.</p>
